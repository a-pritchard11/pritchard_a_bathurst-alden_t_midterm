        <h2 class="hidden">A Hot-Dog IS a Sandwich by Tegan Bathurst-Alden</h2>
        <p>I would argue that the traditional definition of a hot-dog fits the criteria of being a sandwich.<br> Many will argue about the standard that defines a sandwich, but most would agree that it is any food surrounded by bread that can be eaten<br> without getting said food on your hands. Considering this criteria, we can reasonably assume that a hot-dog does indeed qualify.</p>

        <p>The first argument stems entirely from the insignificant fact that the meat of a hot-dog is a cylinder, but that is an irrelevant point.<br> When a ham lover rolls up their ham slices to make a sandwich, do the same rules apply? Would a hamburger, which is technically a very short cylinder,<br> also garner the same controversy? The basic structure in all of these remains the same; bread, subject, condiments, and bread.</p>

        <p>The second argument would be that the bread in this case doesn&apos;t split entirely down the middle when a hot dog is considered.<br> This is another irrelevant point, as many sandwiches are made with bread that is still connected in some way between the two halves.<br> The company Subway, a company that prides itself entirely on sandwiches, doesn&apos;t cut their buns entirely in half.<br> All sub sandwiches would technically not qualify if this argument were valid in any way.</p>

        <p>Lastly, people may argue the orientation of the hot-dog disregards it from being a sandwich. The fact that a typical sandwich is horizontal,<br> while a hot dog is more vertical, does not create a valid argument. Many people eat hot dogs horizontally, with the hot dog itself facing the side<br> and the buns surrounding it facing upwards and downwards respectfully, it all comes down to preference. I would argue that the preference in question,<br> the subjective handling methods of sandwiches and hot-dogs, is an irrelevant point.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, a hot-dog does indeed meet the traditional criteria to be a sandwich, and many of the arguments against it are purely subjective in nature.<br> What cannot be ignored is the objective truth behind the matter that hot-dogs are sandwiches.</p>
