        <h2>A Hot-Dog IS a Sandwich by Tegan Bathurst-Alden</h2>
        <p>I would argue that the traditional definition of a hot-dog fits the criteria of being a sandwich.<br> Many will argue about the standard that defines a sandwich, but most would agree that it is any food surrounded by bread that can be eaten<br> without getting said food on your hands. Considering this criteria, we can reasonably assume that a hot-dog does indeed qualify.</p>

        <p>The first argument stems entirely from the insignificant fact that the meat of a hot-dog is a cylinder, but that is an irrelevant point.<br> When a ham lover rolls up their ham slices to make a sandwich, do the same rules apply? Would a hamburger, which is technically a very short cylinder,<br> also garner the same controversy? The basic structure in all of these remains the same; bread, subject, condiments, and bread.</p>

        <p>The second argument would be that the bread in this case doesn&apos;t split entirely down the middle when a hot dog is considered.<br> This is another irrelevant point, as many sandwiches are made with bread that is still connected in some way between the two halves.<br> The company Subway, a company that prides itself entirely on sandwiches, doesn&apos;t cut their buns entirely in half.<br> You could also break the hot-dog bun in half if you wished. All sub sandwiches would technically not qualify if this argument were valid in any way.</p>

        <p>Lastly, people may argue the orientation of the hot-dog disregards it from being a sandwich. The fact that a typical sandwich is horizontal,<br> while a hot-dog is more vertical, does not create a valid argument. Many people eat hot dogs horizontally, with the hot-dog itself facing the side<br> and the buns surrounding it facing upwards and downwards respectfully, it all comes down to preference. I would argue that the preference in question,<br> the subjective handling methods of sandwiches and hot-dogs, is an irrelevant point.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, a hot-dog does indeed meet the traditional criteria to be a sandwich, and many of the arguments against it are purely subjective in nature.<br> What cannot be ignored is the objective truth behind the matter that hot-dogs are sandwiches.</p>

        <h2>A Hot Dog Is NOT a Sandwich by Alexander Pritchard</h2>
        <p>The question “is a hot dog a sandwich?” has started many arguments throughout my life. <br>It is, in all honesty, a meaningless question. Despite this, many people, including myself, become very passionate about arguing on one side or the other. <br>Today, I hope to give my side and convince any readers that it is the correct one.</p>
        <img src="images/regularsandwich.jpg" alt="an image of a standard sandwich. The gold standard.">
        <p>Firstly, we need to look at the definition of a sandwich. Merriam Webster&apos;s Dictionary defines a sandwich as such: “two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between”. <br>By this definition alone, a hot dog does not meet the requirements to be dubbed a sandwich, being a single piece of bread with meat resting in the middle.</p>
        <p>My partner in this project has made the argument that you could rip apart the bun used to hold the hot dog, and it would become 2 pieces, meaning it would then fulfill the requirements to be labelled a sandwich. <br>In reality, this is making modifications to the original intended design of the hot dog and grossly violating the object to crudely fit into another definition, which does not hold up for their end of the argument. <br>Another example they posited is that a Submarine or “Sub” is a sandwich, despite being a similarly hinged single piece of bread with filling inside. They believe this also proves a hot dog is a sandwich. <br>I believe this to be false, due to the method in which sandwiches are typically eaten. Sandwiches are to be eaten with the bread parallel to the top and bottom of your mouth. <br>You would not eat a sandwich sideways. Subs follow this rule, always eaten as though they were a sandwich, with the top and bottom parallel to the top and bottom of your mouth. A hot dog does not fit into this role either, since it is eaten with the open side facing up.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I would argue that a hot dog, even with its single slice of bread used to contain it, does not satisfy the traditional definition of a sandwich at all. <br>My personal belief is that it is more akin to something like buttered toast. It is not “sandwiched” in between the bread at all. Rather, the bread is there to provide stability to the hot dog and toppings, so that they do not tumble out. The bread does not cover the hot dog in any capacity.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, these points should at the very least make you refrain from lumping the hot dog, which is its own class of food item, in with other food items that are known as sandwiches, because it is not a sandwich.</p>
